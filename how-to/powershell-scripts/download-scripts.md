This dialog enables you to browse through and download the available **predefined PowerShell scripts** from SysKit’s **repository**. There are around **fifty** PowerShell scripts categorized by purpose.  
Most of the available PowerShell scripts can run on all types of servers while others are tied to a specific server role—such as **Domain Controller, IIS,** or **Hyper-V**—or have to be executed on the local machine. It is very important to read the script description on the right side.

If you select a script from the list, the following script information will be displayed:

* **Name** – the name of the script.
* **Description** – the description of the script. It is very important to read the description, as it may clarify the purpose of the script and the specific server role that the script should be executed on.
* **Version** – scripts can be changed and updated with more advanced functionality by our product team.
* **Author** – the name of the author.
* **Date Published** – the date when the script was published.

Depending on which tab is selected, the available options change their purpose:

* **Search box** – Use this option to search through the available scripts. The script description will also be included if it matches the entered criteria.
* **Online tab** – Displays scripts that are ready for installation.
* **Installed tab** – Displays a list of scripts that are already installed. If you want to remove installed scripts, just select them and click the Remove button. Afterwards, the script\(s\) and all related execution data will be deleted.
* **Updates tab** – Displays a list of scripts that have been updated by our product team. If you want to update installed scripts, just select them and click the **Update** button. Afterwards, the script\(s\) will be replaced with new ones, keeping all the previously defined user settings for target computers, triggers, alert conditions and options, etc.

When downloading available PowerShell scripts, simply select the PowerShell scripts and click the **Install** button. After the PowerShell scripts have been downloaded, the success dialog will appear, asking you whether you want the default settings applied or whether you wish to change these settings.  
If you choose the **Manage Scripts** button, the corresponding dialog will open and newly downloaded PowerShell scripts will be marked with a green arrow. The scripts will also appear in the left navigation within their corresponding folder structure.
