## SysKit’s Features

### Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops support

* Citrix Virtual Desktops are now **fully supported** in SysKit Monitor.
* The reports within SysKit Monitor are designed to make it as easy as possible for you to take control of and simplify the reporting and management of your Citrix environment.
* SysKit Monitor automatically detects Citrix servers and starts collecting data for all your Virtual Apps and Desktops. Simply go through the Add Computers Wizard in just a few steps!
* All your Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops names will be resolved to their **published names** and displayed in SysKit Monitor. Discover who is using Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops in your environment and for how long.

### Windows Server 2019 support

* We have been consistently testing Windows Server 2019 throughout the development cycle. This SysKit Monitor release will support Windows Server 2019 from **Day One**.
* Add your Windows Server 2019 VMs using the Add Computers Wizard and browse through the numerous reports in SysKit Monitor.

### Remote Desktop web client support

* SysKit Monitor has supported Microsoft’s native Remote Desktop client ever since it was created in 2008. Now you can monitor and keep track of **browser-based Web client** sessions. 
* Easily discover who’s remotely accessing applications hosted in your environment using the RD Web client. Browse the numerous reports in SysKit Monitor and filter out different client names.

## Improvements

* We have optimized our code and data collection for Citrix servers. Now it works better and faster while communicating with the underlying Citrix infrastructure.
* The **Connection Type** filter in the reports has been completely redesigned. Now it includes **six** different connection types for filtering user sessions: **RDP, Citrix, Citrix Published Apps, Citrix Published Desktops, Disconnected** and **Console**.

## Bug Fixes

* The **Applications** filter in SysKit Monitor web application was not filtering out selected entries properly when exporting reports.
* **Data Collectors** were sometimes displayed as ‘Offline’ in both the Manage Data Collectors dialog and the global warning bar, if the data collection process was taking too long.
