# editions

SysKit Monitor is available in three editions – Standard, Professional, and Enterprise.

## Standard edition

The Standard edition comes with a predefined, basic set of User and Application Reports. You can use these reports to check who is logging into your servers, when they are logging in, and which applications are being used. All SysKit Monitor editions are agentless, which means you can deploy the application in one central location and monitor all servers from a single place. The Standard edition comes with an automatic email report feature that enables you to configure the application to send automatic daily, weekly, or monthly reports to you or your managers. This comes in handy because there is no need to open the application and to search for a particular predefined report. Some of the other available features include automatic billing reports which help you in handling payroll calculation for employees based on defined hourly wage. There is no limitation to the number of monitored servers, it depends on the number of licenses purchased.

This edition can be used with a LocalDB or SQL Server as the database backend.

> **Please note!** If you are using a **LocalDB database**, we recommend that you have at least 10 and no more than 20 monitored servers depending on your server environment. If you wish to monitor more than 20 servers, please use the SQL Server database.

## Professional edition

The Professional edition can be used to monitor Remote Desktop Services and Citrix XenApp farms from a central console and to aggregate data from all servers into one single place. The Professional edition comes with the Event Log Reports, which are used to track security-related information and events on a computer system. This comes in handy because there is no need to open the Event Log on every server and to track when and why the users restart or shutdown their computers or to determine whether the system was recently rebooted.  
The Inventory Reports within SysKit are designed to make it as easy as possible for you to get an overview of everything that is deployed across your server environment and compare differences over time. This feature allows you to track all your assets in a farm, including how many CPUs or NICs are on a server, which applications and updates are installed or available, etc.  
Some of the other available features include File System auditing which allows you to see who accessed, modified, or deleted a particular file on the monitored servers.  
PowerShell Scripts are designed to make it as easy as possible for you to take control and simplify reporting and administration of your Windows environments. If you navigate to Administration &gt; PowerShell Scripts, you will find endless possibilities for the creation of new report and management scripts.

The Professional edition includes all features from the Standard edition.  
We recommend that you deploy the Professional edition with the SQL Server database.

## Enterprise edition

The Enterprise edition is ideal for enterprise multitenancy farms between different domains with or without domain trusts defined. The Enterprise edition allows you to gather data from all your customers into one single place. Afterwards, you can to create billing reports for different customers, compare them to each other, monitor growth of the farms, and everything else you need, all in one spot.  
With multitenancy comes the possibility of role-based administration, which allows you to share different servers or customers with different people.  
The Enterprise edition allows you to collect performance data for the monitored servers. Everything associated with CPU, memory, storage, or bandwidth will be displayed in the Performance Reports.  
In addition, you can view and browse through the available data from your web browser or practically any tablet, including iPads, Android tablets or the Microsoft Surface.

The Enterprise edition includes all features from the Standard and the Professional editions.
