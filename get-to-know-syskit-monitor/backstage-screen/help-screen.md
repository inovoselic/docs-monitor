## Customer Experience Improvement Program

In SysKit Monitor, the **Customer Experience Improvement Program** is, by default, enabled. However, you can disable it if you do not want to participate in the program. We use the program to improve SysKit Monitor features.

When you exit the SysKit Monitor application, we gather the minimum amount of data about feature usage to see which SysKit Monitor features our customers use the most, so we can make them even better.

Please note that the data about feature usage gathered in Customer Experience Improvement Program does not include the content of your reports. Find out more about our [privacy policy](https://www.syskit.com/privacy-policy/).

Click **Check for Updates** to check and download the newest updates.  
We recommend that you select the **Check for Updates automatically** checkbox. If this option is enabled, SysKit Monitor periodically checks for new software versions and informs you when a new version is available for download.
