**Sessions Dashboard** is shown when you start the SysKit application and it enables you to see live data, such as the **current sessions** and **running processes** on all servers. There are five system dashboards which provide a quick overview of user activities, application usage, used licenses and overview of important reports.

* **Dashboard navigation bar** – Provides the list of System Dashboards and custom made dashboards. By navigating throughout them, you will get an easy overview of your computers, users and applications data.
* **Sessions Dashboard chart** – Provides live time graphical overview of sessions in progress.
* **Sessions** – Shows the number of sessions in progress. You can choose which session states you want to display on the Sessions Dashboard chart. Clicking on the **Show current sessions** link provides more detailed report.
* **Computers** – List of active computers and their states. Different computer color marks indicate different computer state. By hovering over the help icon, see the computer color state legend. Clicking on the **Manage Computers** link opens the **Administration – Computers** category which provides more information about each computer individually.

There are **2 visual color indicators** for computers’ sessions:

* **Yellow** – online computer that has reached an alarming number of users \(e.g. 51 users online, the warning threshold is 50\)
* **Red** – online computer that has reached a critical number of users \(e.g. 101 users online, the warning threshold is 100\)

Use the [Administration – Computers](sessions-dashboard.md#internal/get-to-know-syskit-monitor/administration/servers-and-groups) category to adjust the values for **warning** and **critical** session thresholds.

* **Processes** – Number of currently running processes. Clicking on the Show current processes link provides more detailed report.
* **System Job status** – This is an indicator of a system job status, located in the lower-left corner. Here you can:
  * view the system job progress state, computer name on which a system job is currently running and when the job was started,
  * view information about currently running system jobs,
  * open the System Jobs dialog.

It is not possible to edit nor save Session Dashboard as a dashboard template nor change the date range. It is however possible to [edit the other dashboards](sessions-dashboard.md#internal/how-to/dashboards/edit-dashboard).

Users can also [create custom dashboards](sessions-dashboard.md#internal/how-to/dashboards/create-custom-dashboard) that will better meet their needs.
